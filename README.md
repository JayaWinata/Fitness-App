# Fitness App

## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive fitness app that helps users track workout plans, monitor calories, and achieve health goals. It offers personalized workout plans, progress tracking, and various features to support users throughout their fitness journey.

## Key Features
- Personalized workout plans.
- Tracking of body metrics such as weight, height, and calories.
- Progress visualization with graphs.
- Manage and update workout plans.
- Monitor daily calorie intake and progress.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for development.
- **MySQL**: For database management to store user data.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing progress with graphs and charts.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Tkinter / CustomTkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Project Objectives
- Implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure the app using classes, objects, and inheritance.
- Provide functionalities to:
  - Plot user progress (e.g., body weight, height, calories).
  - Add, update, and track user progress.
  - Modify and manage workout plans.
  - Monitor daily calorie intake.

## Limitations
- The app currently does not support real-time syncing with fitness trackers or other health apps.
- User data management could be improved with cloud integration for backup and synchronization across devices.
- **Alternative Approaches**:
  - Instead of using **Tkinter and Python**, the project could be built as a **mobile app** using frameworks like **Flutter** or **React Native** for cross-platform support (iOS and Android).
  - A **web-based version** could be created using **JavaScript frameworks** like **React** or **Vue.js**, with a **Node.js** backend for more scalability.
